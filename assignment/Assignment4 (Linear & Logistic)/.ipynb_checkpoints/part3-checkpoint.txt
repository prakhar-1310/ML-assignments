Assignment Tasks 
Answer the following in brief (2â€“4 sentences each):


1. What are the assumptions of linear regression? 
Ans.Linear regression assumes:
Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of errors.
Normality: Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
No multicollinearity: Independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.


2. When should you use logistic regression instead of linear regression?
Ans. Use logistic regression when the target variable is categorical, especially binary (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). Unlike linear regression, logistic regression is designed to predict probabilities and handle classification tasks.


3. What is the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression?
Ans. Each coefficient represents the change in the log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in the predictor, keeping other variables constant. In other words, it affects the probability of the positive class through the sigmoid function.


4. What is the difference between sigmoid and softmax functions?
Ans. Sigmoid outputs a single probability value between 0 and 1, used in binary classification.
Softmax outputs a probability distribution over multiple classes, used in multi-class classification (sums to 1).


5. Why is R-squared not suitable for evaluating logistic regression models?
Ans. R-squared measures variance explained, which applies to continuous outputs in linear regression. Logistic regression outputs probabilities or class labels, so metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC are more appropriate.
